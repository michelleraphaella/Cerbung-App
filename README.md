4. The Cerbung Details page unveils the evolving story. Storytellers can peruse paragraphs crafted by fellow contributors. If a Cerbung is set to public, storytellers can seamlessly add new paragraphs to the existing narrative. However, for restricted Cerbungs, storytellers have to request access to contribute. Additionally, there's a "Follow" button that allows storytellers to add the Cerbung to their list of favorites (with a dedicated page to access their followed Cerbungs), ensuring they never miss an update of the captivating storyline.
